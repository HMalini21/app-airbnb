# app airbnb

we are creating a airbnb app project

## using props

this is being created by using props

## using .map() method
and here we also use .map() method which is main method because it take function as parameter.

and it does map through the whole function or an array and covert into a jsx element and save it in a new array or an variable 

and currently we are working on this two methods in this project 
where also the unsaid details about components and its main function is present

### using objects as props 

for ex items ={
    id :1
    namae :nilla
}

to change this into props by doing 

i={items}

first we need to assign a variable to the object and then call the assigned value in our program i.e. "i"

the object names and the props are may or may not be same name so we have to change to it the real object name if we have  to use this method i.e {d=d}
{props.d.objectname }
